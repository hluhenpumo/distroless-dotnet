## Troubleshooting Tips
 
If you encounter any problems with installing or activating Hauppauge WinTV 8, here are some tips that may help:

- If you see a message "Run or Save?", click Save when downloading the installer.
- If you have lost your activation code or product code, you can contact Hauppauge support at techsupport@hauppauge.com[^3^]. They can try to look it up with your serial number. To find your serial number, run Prodinfo.exe which is included in the installer package.
- If you are having a problem getting a good TV picture when using an over-the-air TV antenna, you can use the Signal Monitor tool which is part of WinTV 8. It displays the relative strength of the digital signal on the channel you are tuned to[^4^].
- If your TV channel line up has changed due to a change in transmission frequencies, we recommend that you erase the WinTV channel database before you re-scan for channels[^4^].
