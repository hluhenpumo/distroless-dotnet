How does AAMS V3 work? AAMS V3 works by analyzing your audio file and creating a source file that contains information about the frequency spectrum, dynamic range and loudness of your audio. Then, AAMS V3 compares your source file to a reference file that matches your musical style. A reference file is a preset that contains the ideal frequency spectrum, dynamic range and loudness for a certain genre or style of music. AAMS V3 has a reference database of over 200 styles that you can choose from, or you can create your own reference files by using a batch of audio files that you like.
 
Based on the comparison, AAMS V3 calculates the differences and corrections that need to be applied to your audio file to make it sound more like the reference file. These corrections include equalization, compression and loudness adjustments. AAMS V3 shows you the suggested corrections in charts and displays, and lets you listen to the difference before and after applying them. You can also modify the suggested corrections manually by using the 100 band spectrum equalizer or the 8 band multiband compressor. AAMS V3 gives you full control over your audio mastering process.
 
Once you are satisfied with the results, you can export your mastered audio file in various formats, such as WAV, MP3, FLAC, AAC and more.
