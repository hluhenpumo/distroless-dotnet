# Rango: A Hilarious Animated Western with an Algerian Twist
 
Rango is a 2011 animated comedy film directed by Gore Verbinski and featuring the voice of Johnny Depp as the title character, a chameleon who becomes the sheriff of a desert town called Dirt. The film is a spoof of classic westerns, with references to films like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, High Noon, and Rangoon. But what makes Rango unique is that it also has a version dubbed in Algerian Arabic, which adds a layer of humor and cultural relevance for Algerian audiences.

The Algerian version of Rango was released in 2012 by the production company DZ Toons, which specializes in dubbing foreign animated films into Algerian dialect. The dubbing team included actors like Sid Ahmed Agoumi, Mohamed Adjaimi, and Nabil Asli, who gave Rango and his friends distinctive Algerian accents and expressions. For example, Rango's catchphrase "I'm a man of action" becomes "Ana rajel el haraka", which means "I'm a man of movement" in Algerian Arabic. The dubbing also added jokes and references to Algerian politics, history, and culture, such as mentioning the Algerian War of Independence, the Berber identity, and the popular singer Cheb Khaled.
 
The Algerian version of Rango was well received by critics and audiences alike, who praised its creativity and originality. The film won several awards at the 2013 Algiers International Film Festival, including Best Dubbing, Best Adaptation, and Best Soundtrack. The film also became a cult hit among Algerian youth, who shared clips and memes of Rango on social media. The film's success inspired DZ Toons to dub other animated films into Algerian Arabic, such as Madagascar 3, Ice Age 4, and The Croods.
 
If you want to watch Rango in its Algerian version, you can download it from various torrent sites online. However, be careful of malware and viruses that may infect your device. You can also watch it on YouTube or Dailymotion, but be aware that the quality may not be optimal. Alternatively, you can buy or rent the DVD from local stores or online platforms. Whatever you choose, you will surely enjoy this hilarious and adventurous film that combines western and Algerian elements in a unique way.
  
The film also received critical acclaim from many reviewers, who praised its animation, story, humor, and voice acting. The film has a 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 227 reviews, with an average score of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Rango is a smart, giddily creative burst of beautifully animated entertainment, and Johnny Depp gives a colorful vocal performance as a household pet in an unfamiliar world."[^2^] The film also has a 75/100 score on Metacritic, based on 35 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[^4^]
 
Some of the critics who gave positive reviews include Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film four out of four stars and wrote: "Rango is some kind of a miracle: An animated comedy for smart moviegoers, wonderfully made, great to look at, wickedly satirical, and (gasp!) filmed in glorious 2-D. Its brilliant colors and startling characters spring from the screen and remind us how very, very tired we are of simpleminded little characters bouncing around dimly in 3-D."[^1^] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film four out of four stars and called it "a wild and woolly blend of animation and live action that dazzles the eye and tickles the funny bone." He added: "Depp is a vocal magician, finding nuance even in nonsense. And Verbinski shows a rare gift for blending action and laughs. Rango is a knockout."
 
However, not all critics were impressed by Rango. Some of the negative reviews came from Kyle Smith of the New York Post, who gave the film one and a half out of four stars and wrote: "Rango is like a parched throat crying out for water. It's an animated comedy that keeps telling you it's clever without being either." He criticized the film's lack of originality, coherence, and appeal for children. Claudia Puig of USA Today also gave the film one and a half out of four stars and said: "Rango is an animated Western that aims to be both surreal and funny but ends up being neither." She found the film's humor too adult-oriented and its characters too grotesque.
 
Rango was also a commercial success, grossing $245.7 million worldwide against a budget of $135 million. It was the highest-grossing animated film of 2011 until it was surpassed by Kung Fu Panda 2. It also won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, making it the first non-Pixar film to win since 2006's Happy Feet.
